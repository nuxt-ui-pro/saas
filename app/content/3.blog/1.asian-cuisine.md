  label: 'Ingredients'
  icon: 'i-heroicons-fire'
  ---
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 3/4 cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/4 cup plain yogurt
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil or melted ghee

  ---
  label: 'Instructions'
  icon: 'i-heroicons-list-bullet-20-solid'
  ---
  - **Activate the Yeast:**
  In a small bowl, combine the active dry yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

  - **Prepare the Dough:**
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda.
  Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, and olive oil.
  Mix the ingredients until a dough forms.

  - **Knead the Dough:**
  Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

  - **Let it Rise:**
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.

  - **Preheat the Oven:**
  Preheat your oven to the highest setting, usually around 500°F (260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.

  - **Divide and Shape:**
  Divide the dough into equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.
  Roll out each ball into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.

  - **Bake:**
  If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out naan directly onto the stone in the preheated oven. Alternatively, place the rolled-out naan on a baking sheet.
  Bake for 5-7 minutes or until the naan puffs up and the edges turn golden brown.

  - **Optional Toppings:**
  Brush the hot naan with melted ghee or butter and sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro if desired.

  - **Serve:**
  Serve the naan warm, either as a side to your favorite curry or as a delicious flatbread.
