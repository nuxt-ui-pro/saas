  label: 'Ingredients'
  icon: 'i-heroicons-fire'
  ---
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 3/4 cup warm water (about 110Â°F or 43Â°C)
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/4 cup plain yogurt
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil or melted ghee

  label: 'Instructions'
  icon: 'i-heroicons-list-bullet-20-solid'
  ---
  - **Activate the Yeast:**
  In a small bowl, combine the active dry yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

  - **Prepare the Dough:**
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda.
  Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, and olive oil.
  Mix the ingredients until a dough forms.

  - **Knead the Dough:**
  Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

  - **Let it Rise:**
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.

  - **Preheat the Oven:**
  Preheat your oven to the highest setting, usually around 500Â°F (260Â°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.

  - **Divide and Shape:**
  Divide the dough into equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.
  Roll out each ball into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.

  - **Bake:**
  If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out naan directly onto the stone in the preheated oven. Alternatively, place the rolled-out naan on a baking sheet.
  Bake for 5-7 minutes or until the naan puffs up and the edges turn golden brown.

  Brush the hot naan with melted ghee or butter and sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro if desired.

  Serve the naan warm, either as a side to your favorite curry or as a delicious flatbread.
