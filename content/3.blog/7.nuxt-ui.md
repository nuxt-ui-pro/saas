## Introduction

Nuxt UI is a module that provides a set of Vue components and composables built with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI to help you build beautiful and accessible user interfaces.
Its goal is to provide everything related to UI when building a Nuxt app. This includes components, icons, colors, dark mode but also keyboard shortcuts.

### âœ¨ Awesome Features

- Built with Headless UI and Tailwind CSS
- HMR support through Nuxt App Config
- Dark mode support
- Support for LTR and RTL languages
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Bundled icons
- Fully typed
- Figma Kit

## ðŸ˜Œ Easy and quick installation

### Setup

1. Install `@nuxt/ui` dependency to your project:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxt/ui
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxt/ui
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxt/ui
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @nuxt/ui
```

::

2. Add it to your `modules` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/ui']
})
```

That's it! You can now use all the components and composables in your Nuxt app ðŸ¤©

### Automatically installed modules

Nuxt UI will automatically install the [@nuxtjs/tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/), [@nuxtjs/color-mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/) and [nuxt-icon](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon) modules for you.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
You should remove them from your `modules` and `dependencies` if you've previously installed them.
::

### ...And all in Typescript !

This module is written in TypeScript and provides typings for all the components and composables.

You can use those types in your own components by importing them from `#ui/types`, for example when defining wrapper components:

```vue
<template>
  <UBreadcrumb :links="links">
    <template #icon="{ link }">
      <UIcon :name="link.icon" />
    </template>
  </UBreadcrumb>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import type { BreadcrumbLink } from '#ui/types'

export interface Props {
  links: BreadcrumbLink[]
}

defineProps<Props>()
</script>
```

### The power of IntelliSense

If you're using VSCode, you can install the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension to get autocompletion for the classes.

You can read more on how to set it up on the [@nuxtjs/tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/tailwind/editor-support) module documentation.

### Many options

| Key                   | Default         | Description                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prefix`              | `u`             | Define the prefix of the imported components.                                                               |
| `global`              | `false`         | Expose components globally.                                                                                 |
| `icons`               | `['heroicons']` | Icon collections to load.                                                                                   |
| `safelistColors`      | `['primary']`   | Force safelisting of colors to need be purged.                                                              |
| `disableGlobalStyles` | `false`         | Disable [global CSS styles](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/blob/dev/src/runtime/ui.css) injected by the module. |

Configure options in your `nuxt.config.ts` as such:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/ui'],
  ui: {
    global: true,
    icons: ['mdi', 'simple-icons']
  }
})
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Theming

### Colors

#### Configuration

Components are based on a `primary` and a `gray` color. You can change them in your `app.config.ts`.

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    primary: 'green',
    gray: 'cool'
  }
})
```

As this module uses Tailwind CSS under the hood, you can use any of the [Tailwind CSS colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) or your own custom colors. By default, the `primary` color is `green` and the `gray` color is `cool`.

When [using custom colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-custom-colors) or [adding additional colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#adding-additional-colors) through the `extend` key in your `tailwind.config.ts`, you'll need to make sure to define all the shades from `50` to `950` as most of them are used in the components config defined in [`ui.config.ts`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/blob/dev/src/runtime/ui.config.ts). You can [generate your colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#generating-colors) using tools such as https://uicolors.app/ for example.

### Components

#### `app.config.ts`

Components are styled with Tailwind CSS but classes are all defined in the default [ui.config.ts](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/blob/dev/src/runtime/ui.config.ts) file. You can override those in your own `app.config.ts`.

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    container: {
      constrained: 'max-w-5xl'
    }
  }
})
```

Thanks to [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge), the `app.config.ts` is smartly merged with the default config. This means you don't have to rewrite everything.

#### `ui` prop

Each component has a `ui` prop that allows you to customize everything specifically.

```vue
<template>
  <UContainer :ui="{ constrained: 'max-w-2xl' }">
    <slot />
  </UContainer>
</template>
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
You can find the default classes for each component under the `Config` section.
::

### Dark mode

All the components are styled with dark mode in mind.

:color-mode-button

### Icons

You can use any icon (100,000+) from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

Some components have an `icon` prop that allows you to add an icon to the component.

```vue
<template>
  <UButton icon="i-heroicons-magnifying-glass" />
</template>
```
