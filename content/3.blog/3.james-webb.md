  ### Designing the Future
  In the bustling halls of NASA's engineering facilities, a team of brilliant minds gathered around blueprints and prototypes. They envisioned a telescope unlike any other, one that would revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. Led by Dr. Catherine Nguyen, they meticulously crafted the design for what would become the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With its massive primary mirror and cutting-edge infrared technology, the JWST promised to unveil the deepest mysteries of the universe.
